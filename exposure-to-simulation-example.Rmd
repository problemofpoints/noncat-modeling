# Illustrative non-cat exposure analysis to loss simulation example

Using a simplified, one line of business example, this notebook will:

- Perform an exposure analysis to estimate expected losses to excess of loss reinsurance layers
- Squish parametric ground up loss distributions by policy limit into a single piecewise linear distribution
- MAYBE: adjust piecewise linear distribution for custom view of large losses
- Simulate ground up losses using the collective risk model with frequency contagion parameter

```{r setup}
